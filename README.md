# Language-Image-Pretraining
implement CLIP BLIP SigLIP to CIFAR-10

By default, the clip library uses the torch.hub mechanism to manage pretrained model downloads. The pretrained CLIP models are saved in the following location on MacBook:
```
~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints
```

all .py scripts can be run independently from the root of this project.
